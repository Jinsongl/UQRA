\begin{abstract}
  {\it In reliability analysis, the objective is to evaluate the probability of failure of a system corresponding to a predefined reference period with respective to some performance functions. Various methods have been proposed to solve this problem efficiently, like Monte Carlo based sampling methods, approximation based FORM/SORM and surrogate models. However, the efficiency of these methods will decrease exponentially as the dimension of the problem increases. Even though the dimension-free property of Monte Carlo based methods are attractive, the slow convergence rate ($\propto 1/\sqrt{N}$) makes those approaches particularly inefficient. For an offshore system, the dimension of the random variables could easily be hundreds or thousands due to the existence of random phases when applying wind and/or wave spectrum. In this paper we propose to isolate the uncertainties induced due to environment random variables and random phases. Phase-conditioned meta-models, which are inexpensive to evaluate in contrast to the original model, are constructed based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) under the framework of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). The uncertainty of random phases will then be taken into account by bootstrapping from phase-conditioned meta-model pools. Since it is impossible to quantify the error made with surrogate model, this approach is first applied to a single DOF dynamic system with external wave loads. A few metrics are compared to assess the accuracy of this method against crude Monte Carlo method. The 50-year return loads of the SNL 13.2 MW semi-submersible floating offshore wind turbine model is eventually obtained with the constructed PCE surrogate models}

meta model for structural reliability and UQ \cite{sudret2012meta}

The accuracy of Polynomial chaos approximation \cite{field2004accuracy}

Three possible sources of discrepancy between simulation and experimental observations may be distinguished: Model inadequacy, Numerical Error and Input parameter uncertainty. Only the uncertainty in input parameters is addressed in this work. Probabilistic methods based on the representation of uncertain input parameters by random variables or random fields.

Non intrusive method, which only make use of a series of calls to the deterministic model. Also minimize the number of calls to the model.

Alternative is response surface method or metamodels. PCE: spectral methods provide a polynomial metamodel onto a basis that is well suited to post-processing in uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. Cons: Metamodeling reveal efficient and accurate for a moderate number of input parameters. Besides, Difficult in estimation of the approximation error, which directly depend on the goodness-of-fit of the metamodel. Reliable error estimate allow to design an adaptive refinement of the metamodel 

Let$ \left( \Omega, F, P \right)$ be a probability space, where $\Omega$ is the event space equipped with $\sigma$-algebra and probability measure $P$. Throughout this work, random variables are denoted by upper case letters $X(\omega): \Omega \to D_{X} \in R$, while their realizations are denoted by the corresponding lower case letters. Moreover, bold upper and lower case letters are used to denote random vectors and their realizations, respectively.

Standard methods for uncertainty propagation.

Statistical point view: Unbiased Estimator, However slow convergence rate. could be improved by LHS and QMC.
By definition, could also be viewed as integration. Quadrature rule could be applied. Curse of dimensionality. Could be improved by sparse quadrature schemes.



\section*{SDOF system}
Single DOF system defined by natural frequency and damping ratio. $\omega_n = 0.15 Hz, \zeta = 0.1$. 

\textbf{System transfer function as following}
\begin{equation*}
  H(\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1 - \frac{\omega}{\omega_n})^2 + (2\zeta\frac{\omega}{\omega_n})^2}}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{External loads are assumed to be wave loads. JONSWAP wave spectrum is used as recommend by standard IEC 61400-3}

Pierson-Moskowitz (PM) spectrum $S_{PM}(\omega)$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
S_{PM}(\omega) = \frac{5}{16} \cdot H_s^2 \omega_p^4 \cdot \omega^{-5} \mathrm{exp}\left(-\frac{5}{4}\left( \frac{\omega}{\omega_p} \right)^{-4}\right)
  \label{eqn:Pierson-Moskowitz}
\end{equation}

where $\omega_p = 2\pi/T_p$ is the angular spectral peak frequency.

JONSWAP Spectrum:

\begin{equation}
  S_J(\omega) = A_\gamma S_{PM}(\omega) \gamma^{\mathrm{exp}\left[-0.5(\frac{\omega-\omega_p}{\sigma \cdot \omega_p})^2\right]}
  \label{eqn:JONSWAP}
\end{equation}
where $S_{PM}(\omega)$ is pierson-Moskowitz spectrum, $\gamma = 3.3$ is non-dimensional peak shape parameter. $\sigma$ is spectral width parameter, $\sigma = \sigma_a = 0.07$ for $\omega \leq \omega_p$ and $\sigma = \sigma_b = 0.09$ for $\omega > \omega_p$. $A_\gamma = 1 - 0.287 \mathrm{ln} (\gamma)$ is a normalizing factor.

\textbf{Check if the variance of system introduced due to random phases is comparable with wind turbine system.}

To achieve $10^{-6}$ failure probability with $CV_{p_f} \leq 10\%$, requires about $10^{8}$ simulations

\section{PCE Structural Reliability}

Xiu in \cite{xiu2002wiener} proposed and numerically demonstrated the optimal (exponential) convergence rate of each Wiener-Askey polynomial chaos expansion for its corresponding stochastic process. Idealy, if the independent variable $\zeta$ in the polynomials ${\Phi_i(\zeta)}$ belong to the basic types as shown in Wiener-Askey scheme, the exponential convergence rate could be achieved. However, like the Weilbull and Lognormal distributions used in the current research, we often encounter distributions of random inputs not listed. A transformation could be used to map the target random variables to basic random variables. 

The target is the 50-year return loads. Based on Possion process assumption etc, we can evalute the extreme loads based on the maximum load within simulation duration. If conditions ** meets, block maxima will follow generalized extreme value distributions.

Quantity of interest (QoI) could be defined as following


$y_{max} ^i$ represents the maximum response value of the $i^{th}$ simulation with duration 400 seconds, $i = 1, \dots 100$.  $\mathrm{max}\left\{ y_{max}^i \right\} / \mathrm{mean}\left\{  y_{max}^i \right\}  $ is selected to indicate the random phases variance. 

a standard uniform random variable is first chosen, $u \in U(0,1)$. The CDFs for physical random variable $\bs{x}$ and random variable $\bs{\zeta}$ chosen from the list are $F_{\bs{X}}$ and $F_{\bs{Z}}$. Then we can set $u = F_{\bs{X}}(x) = F_{\bs{Z}}(\zeta)$
Howver since we don't know what is the best for that distribution, this approximiation could be reasonable.

Random variables: $\bs{X}$, Environmental Random variables. $\bs{\Theta}$: Random phases. $Y = f(\bs{X}, \bs{\Theta})$ \iffalse $Y(t) = f(t,\bs{X}, \bs{\Theta})$ \fi : response with unknown marginal distribution $F_Y$. Note that $\bs{\Theta}$ and $\bs{X}$ are independent.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \Pr \left( Y > y_0 \right) 
  &= \int \Pr \left( f(\bs{X} | \bs{\Theta}) > y_0 \right) f_{\bs{\Theta}}\left( \bs{\Theta} = \bs{\theta} \right) d \bs{\Theta} \\
%  &= \iint \Pr \left( Y > y_0 | \bs{\Theta} = \bs{\theta}, \bs{X} = \bs{x} \right) f_{\bs{\Theta}}\left( \bs{\Theta} = \bs{\theta} \right) f_{\bs{X}}(\bs{X} = \bs{x}) d \bs{\Theta} d \bs{X} \\
  &=\iint \Pr \left( f(\bs{x},\bs{\theta}) > y_0  \right) f_{\bs{X}}(\bs{X} = \bs{x}) d \bs{X} f_{\bs{\Theta}}\left( \bs{\Theta} = \bs{\theta} \right) d \bs{\Theta}   \\ 
  %&= \iint \Pr \left( y(\bs{X}) \right)
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eqn:Reli_PCE_WindTurbine}
\end{equation}

The idea to solve this problem is to seperate the uncertainty introduced by random phases and physical random variables. According to TurbSim, the random numbers generated by the pRNG are used to create random phases (one per frequency per grid point per wind component) for the velocity time series. The difficulty to quantify the phase uncertainties comes from the large dimensions and the dimension changes as we create or apply different wind model. In addition, we can bearly control the random phases unless we know the pRNG. Thus the following alternatives are proposed. Say, our goal is 50-year return loads and simulation duration is 1-hour. Our QoI can either be the block maxima (assumptions here like possion process; POT works here?) or the time series itself.

Define the maxima in duration $T$ is $y_{max}$. Then the QoI can be expressed with PCE as following:
\begin{equation}
  y_{max}^K (\bs{x} | \bs{\theta}) = \sum _{k=0}^K \alpha_k \Phi_k(\bs{u})
  \label{eqn:Block_maxima_PCE}
\end{equation}

If the QoI is the time series, then expression can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  y^K(\bs{x},t) = \sum _{k=0} ^ K \alpha_k (t) \Phi_k(\bs{u})
  \label{eqn:TimeSeries_PCE}
\end{equation}

The inner integral conditional on $\Theta$ in Eqn. \ref{eqn:Reli_PCE_WindTurbine} can be appxomiated as:

\begin{equation}
  \Pr \left( Y > y_0 | \Theta \right)  = \int \Pr \left( y_{max}^K (\bs{x}|\bs{\theta}) > y_0 \right) f_{\bs{X}} d \bs{X}
  \label{eqn:Reli_BM_PCE}
\end{equation}
Or

\begin{equation}
  \Pr \left( Y > y_0 | \Theta \right)  = \int \Pr \left( y^K (\bs{x},t|\bs{\theta}) > y_0 \right) f_{\bs{X}} d \bs{X}
  \label{eqn:Reli_TS_PCE}
\end{equation}

The next step is to account for the outer integral, sampling from $\Theta$ space. One critical question is then to choose the proper number of samples $N_\theta$ to represent the distribution as well as to quantify the uncertainty."Repeat for $N_\theta$ times with different $\theta$ samples. (need a metric to determine)

Once this step is done, the following algorithm could be used to estimate the 50-year return load.

number of samples(numSamples) = 50 year / T \\
\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}
	\For{ $i = 1 \colon \mathrm{numSamples}$}
	  \State $X_i \sim F_{\bs{X}}$
	  \State select $\bs{\theta}$ from pre-runned $\theta$ pool
	  \Comment{Can pick $\theta$ uniformly from $N_{\theta}$ samples or add weight based on sampling results}
	  \State $y_{max}^i = y_{max}^K (X_i, \theta)$
	\EndFor
	\State 50 year return load = $\mathrm{max } \left\{ y_{max}^i \right\}$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

	  \State $y_{max}^i = \mathrm{max}\left\{y^K (X_i, t,\theta) \right\}$
	\EndFor
	\State 50 year return load = $\mathrm{max } \left\{ y_{max}^i \right\}$

%\section*{CITING REFERENCES}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The ASME reference format is defined in the authors kit provided by the ASME.  The format is:

%\begin{quotation}
%{\em Text Citation}. Within the text, references should be cited in  numerical order according to their order of appearance.  The numbered reference citation should be enclosed in brackets.
%\end{quotation}

%The references must appear in the paper in the order that they were cited.  In addition, multiple citations (3 or more in the same brackets) must appear as a `` [1-3]''.  A complete definition of the ASME reference format can be found in the  ASME manual \cite{asmemanual}.

%The bibliography style required by the ASME is unsorted with entries appearing in the order in which the citations appear. If that were the only specification, the standard {\sc Bib}\TeX\ unsrt bibliography style could be used. Unfortunately, the bibliography style required by the ASME has additional requirements (last name followed by first name, periodical volume in boldface, periodical number inside parentheses, etc.) that are not part of the unsrt style. Therefore, to get ASME bibliography formatting, you must use the \verb+asmems4.bst+ bibliography style file with {\sc Bib}\TeX. This file is not part of the standard BibTeX distribution so you'll need to place the file someplace where LaTeX can find it (one possibility is in the same location as the file being typeset).

%With \LaTeX/{\sc Bib}\TeX, \LaTeX\ uses the citation format set by the class file and writes the citation information into the .aux file associated with the \LaTeX\ source. {\sc Bib}\TeX\ reads the .aux file and matches the citations to the entries in the bibliographic data base file specified in the \LaTeX\ source file by the \verb+\bibliography+ command. {\sc Bib}\TeX\ then writes the bibliography in accordance with the rules in the bibliography .bst style file to a .bbl file which \LaTeX\ merges with the source text.  A good description of the use of {\sc Bib}\TeX\ can be found in \cite{latex, goosens} (see how 2 references are handled?).  The following is an example of how three or more references \cite{latex, asmemanual,  goosens} show up using the \verb+asmems4.bst+ bibliography style file in conjunction with the \verb+asme2e.cls+ class file. Here are some more \cite{art, blt, ibk, icn, ips, mts, mis, pro, pts, trt, upd} which can be used to describe almost any sort of reference.

\section{Model Selection}
Goals in model selection include: accurate predictions, interpretable models(determining which predictors are meaningful), stability(small changes in the data should not result in large changes in either the subset of predictors used, the associated coefficients, or the predictors), and avoiding bias in the hypothesis tests during or after variable selection.

Stepwise regression and All-subsets regression:

Monochromatic wave in time 
\[ \eta(t) = a \cos(\omega t + \theta_n)\]
Amplitude $[m]:a $; Angular frequency $[rad/s]: \omega = 2\pi f$; Wave period $[s]: T = \frac{1}{f}$; Phase $[rad]: \theta_n$ 

Notation (I):
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
	\eta(t) &= \sum_n a_n \cos (\omega_n t +\theta_n) \\
	\eta(t) &= \sum_n c_n e^{i\omega_n t} + c.c
